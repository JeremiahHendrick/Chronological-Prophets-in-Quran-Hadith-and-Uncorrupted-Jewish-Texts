  <h1>Chronological Prophets in Quran, Hadith and Uncorrupted Jewish Texts</h1>
  <p>This document lists prophets mentioned in the Quran, hadith collections and, where relevant, figures from authentic history and uncorrupted Jewish sources.  Prophets are presented in approximate chronological order with concise information about their era, geographic region or tribe, their mission and challenges, and any scriptures associated with them.  Images accompany the earliest prophets – faces are intentionally not shown out of respect for Islamic artistic conventions.  For later prophets, image generation was interrupted and therefore no depiction is provided.</p>
